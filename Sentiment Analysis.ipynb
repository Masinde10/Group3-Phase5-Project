    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Online business platforms like Amazon generate millions of customer reviews daily, influencing purchasing decisions and shaping brand reputations. These reviews offer valuable insights into customer satisfaction, product quality, and service efficiency. Sentiment analysis, a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enables businesses to analyze and interpret customer emotions from text data. By automating this process, companies can enhance customer experience, improve products, and drive sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "### Real-World Problem\n",
    "With thousands of reviews per product, customers and businesses struggle to extract meaningful insights manually. The challenge lies in identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment efficiently. Traditional rating systems (1-5 stars) may not always reflect the true sentiment behind a review, as users may express mixed opinions in text form. A sentiment analysis system can provide a more accurate and automated way of understanding customer feedback, helping businesses enhance their products and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "This project is valuable to multiple stakeholders, each benefiting in different ways from sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) E-commerce Businesses & Product Sellers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain insights into customer satisfaction and product performance.\n",
    "- Identify recurring complaints and areas for improvement.\n",
    "- Monitor brand reputation and respond to negative feedback effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Consumers & Online Shoppers\n",
    "- Get data-driven product recommendations based on real customer sentiments.\n",
    "- Make informed purchasing decisions by understanding overall product sentiment.\n",
    "- Avoid misleading star ratings by analyzing actual customer experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Marketing & Customer Support Teams\n",
    "- Track customer sentiment trends to refine marketing strategies.\n",
    "- Automate review analysis to address complaints and improve customer service.\n",
    "- Identify key influencers and brand advocates from positive reviews."
